      <p>In 2017 the revenue product team set out to evaluate our internal tools and found one of the main product offerings had grown stale as a product and user flows were being affected negatively by it. The tool, which runs all of vox media’s premium ads across multiple networks, had not grown with new and bigger demands and needed some rethinking to get things done in a more efficient and easier way.</p>

<p>The hope was to make creating and building ads much easier along with reducing the user friction at certain pain points in the creation by rethinking and modernizing the tool.</p>

      <p>In early 2018 I was asked to assist in reworking the design system used at vox media to make it more sustainable and scalable as vox’s needs for it grow. I was brought in to help clean and organize the system along with giving input and helping revise workflow so that the tool can used by future product designers to quickly devise and iterate on upcoming platforms.</p>

      <p>In late 2016 we spun up a new team to rethink a tool used by our ad operations team called insights — it’s our analytics platform that we use to track performance with brand partners.</p>

<p>I focused on helping build out the modular based design system and helped us develop patterns to be used in this and other apps we had planned. One of the main challenges was determining what things were worth pulling out as significant and making the system more approachable by using natural language summaries.</p>

      <p>In early 2013 vox media partnered with Ezra Klein and Melissa Bell to help build the future of news. This was one of my first projects I worked on at vox media and was one of the most rewarding and hectic experiences I’ve had here. It was a super fast 6 week project from start to finish that was built off the base of another one of vox media’s networks to give this a jump start (this also launched discussions of a platform unification called unison). During the project, I was primarily involved with the homepage and things that would engage the users to “eat their vegetables” (in Ezra’s words), where we would encourage rabbit holing information so people would consume less exciting topics to get context for bigger stories.</p>

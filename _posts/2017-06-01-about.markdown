hi, i'm matt. i'm a ux/product designer who's been working in the digital medium since 2010.

currently, I work on product design for internal tools @ [vox media](http://www.voxmedia.com/). when i'm not at work or thinking about bad dark web patterns i enjoy baking and lounging around my apartment with my cat.

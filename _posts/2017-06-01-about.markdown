hi, i'm matt. i'm a ux/product designer who's been working in the digital medium since 2010.

currently, I'm doing product design for internal tools @ [vox media](http://www.voxmedia.com/). when I'm not thinking about bad dark patterns or modular design elements i enjoy baking and lounging around with my cat, Ï‡.

any questions please [reach out](mailto:msullivanxi@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20Matt) otherwise enjoy the limited selection of work below.

Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a ux/product designer who's be working in the digital medium since 2010.

Currently, I work on product design for internal tools @ [vox media](http://www.voxmedia.com/). When I'm not at work or thinking about bad dark web patterns I enjoy baking and lounging around my apartment with my cat.

Any questions please [reach out](mailto:msullivanxi@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20Matt) otherwise enjoy the limited selection of work below.

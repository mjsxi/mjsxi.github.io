Hymnal is Vox Media's internal ad platform, this project â€” which was instrumental in rethinking how ad were built for scale over all premium ads run on Vox Media websites onto one platform, built on a single codebase and shared design system. The project took two years to complete and involved more than 350 websites across our eight editorial brands.

For the better part of last year, I worked on the product design and development of Vox Media's proprietary custom display and native ad unit publishing platform, Hymnal.

I worked on a small but mighty team on creating the best user experience possible on a platform that's a workhorse for the company's bottom line. I've had the pleasure of conducting several product design sprints with the team, guiding/contributing to everything from wireframes to sketching to prototyping to ultimately testing the platform on users.
